(defmacro defscore
  "Define a ko score and prepare it for playing. A basic score consists
  of number vector pairs. Numbers indicate beats in a measure e.g. 1.5
  is the first offbeat of the measure. The vector contains `begin`, `adjust`,
  `finish` and `curve` actions to be executed at the time that corresponds with the
  adjacent number.

  E.g. The following plays two gestures, one starting on beat
  one and the other starting the offbeat of beat two. Both end on beat one of
  the following measure.

  (defscore
    1 [(begin :ssg :my-gesture my-gesture-spec)]
    2.5 [(begin :ssg :next-gesture next-gesture-spec)])

    1 [(finish :my-gesture :next-gesture)]

  `adjust` and `curve` actions control gestures as they are playing, but do so
  differently.

  `adjust` is used to alter parameters of a running synth at
  a specific time while it is playing. The following will change
  the `amp` param of :my-gesture to -12 decibels on beat 3 of the
  corresponding measure:

  3 (adjust :my-gesture {:amp -12})

  `curve` is used to specify control envelope breakpoints for smooth
  changes over the course of a gesture by calculating the time
  difference between a gesture's `begin` and successive `curve` actions.
  Unlike `alter`, `curve` generates a new synthdef under the hood and does
  not send additional OSC messages to scsynth while the score is playing.

  The following begins a gesture on beat two that crescendos along an
  exponential curve (specified by :exp) to -6 decibels on beat one of
  the following measure before ending on beat three:

  2 (begin :ssg :my-gesture {:instr test-synth :amp -24 :freq :c4})

  1 (curve :my-gesture {:amp [-6 :exp]})
  3 (finish :my-gesture)

  Aside from specifying gestures, the defscore macro provides for setting
  the time signature:

  (beats-per-bar 4)
  (beats-per-minute 80)

  and specifying a no actions take place in a measure:
